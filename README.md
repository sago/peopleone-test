Documentation is like sex, something is better that nothing...

This is a test for PeopleOne

* Ruby version 2.2.3pk173, rails 5.1.4
* I use Rails because conventions are easy to speed up a small application
* Instructions to install: clone the repository, create DB and run migrations.
  - bundle exec rake db:create
  - bundle exec rake db:migrate
  - bundle exec rake db:seed
* This is a responsive UI so, you can browse it from any device and borwser(works better in Chrome)
* Pendings:
  - Add authentication
  - Sort tables by column
  - Export to csv, xls, pdf functionality
  - Build tables with React components to improve the performance
